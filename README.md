PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

In our society, we have people with disabilities. The technology is developing day by day but no significant developments
are undertaken for the betterment of these people. Communications between deaf-mute and a normal person has always been
a challenging task. It is very difficult for mute people to convey their message to normal people. Since normal people are
not trained on hand sign language. In emergency times conveying their message is very difficult. The human hand has remained
a popular choice to convey information in situations where other forms like speech cannot be used. Voice Conversion 
System with Hand Gesture Recognition and translation will be very useful to have a proper conversation between a normal 
person and an impaired person in any language.
